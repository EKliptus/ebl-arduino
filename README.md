### Event-Based Library for Arduino

* AdvancedSerial - Serial communication library with a C# .Net client. [Usage](https://github.com/renatoferreirarenatoferreira/ebl-arduino/blob/wiki/AdvancedSerial.md)
* AnalogEvent - Event handler to listen for analog changes. [Usage](https://github.com/renatoferreirarenatoferreira/ebl-arduino/blob/wiki/AnalogEvent.md)
* ButtonEvent - Event handler for analog and digital buttons. [Usage](https://github.com/renatoferreirarenatoferreira/ebl-arduino/blob/wiki/ButtonEvent.md)
* LedControl - Asynchronous led controller. [Usage](https://github.com/renatoferreirarenatoferreira/ebl-arduino/blob/wiki/LedControl.md)
* Properties - Data storage handler. [Usage](https://github.com/renatoferreirarenatoferreira/ebl-arduino/blob/wiki/Properties.md)
* RTCTimedEvent - Event scheduler based on real time clocks, like unix cron scheduler. [Usage](https://github.com/renatoferreirarenatoferreira/ebl-arduino/blob/wiki/RTCTimedEvent.md)
* TimedEvent - Event scheduler based on time intervals. [Usage](https://github.com/renatoferreirarenatoferreira/ebl-arduino/blob/wiki/TimedEvent.md)

P.S.: These modules are outdated and I don't think it will work with newer versions of Arduino's API or boards. I can try to help someone interested in get them working, but I don't have the newers boards to test it.
